# StackWithValidParentheses
This repository contains a custom implementation of the Stack data structure in Java with essential operations like push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. It also solves a popular problem of validating parentheses strings ((), {}, []) by leveraging the stack. The solution is efficient and follows optimal time complexity for all operations.
